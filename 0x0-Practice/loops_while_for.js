// How to talk to my terminal using node.js,  with this problem below i am asking is 1 greater than 2, and when i ask node its anser will be false. Thats a boolean expression.
// console.log(1 > 2); = false
// > greater than
{/* < less than
== loosely equals to
=== strictly equals
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
!= is not equal
//  */}

// 3 min activity using boolean expressions
/*
Check: is -10 greater-than-or-equal-to -100? true
Check: is 0 less than 1000? true
Check: is 888 the same as 889? false
Check: is 20 less-than-or-equal-to 20? true
*/

// console.log(-10 >= -100);
// console.log(0 < 1000);
// console.log(888 == 889);
// console.log(20 <= 20);

// WHILE LOOPS
// Write another while loop, but write it from memory. Make the loop count from 0 to 5000 and print the square of each number. 
// I didnt get what they meant by "print the square of each number"
// let num = 1;

// while (num <= 5000) {
// 	console.log(num);
//     num++;
//     Math.pow([num]*2);
//     }
  

// Trying to find the square of each number in the while loop
// In while loops we set the variable assigned value outside of the loop


// let num = 1;
// while (num <= 10) {
//    console.log(Math.sqrt(num));
//     num++;

// }
